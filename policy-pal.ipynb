      "While life insurance is often associated with providing for dependents, it can also serve other purposes, such as covering funeral expenses or leaving a financial legacy. The need for life insurance depends on individual circumstances and financial goals. If you have no dependents and no significant financial obligations, you may not have a pressing need for life insurance. However, it's always a good idea to evaluate your specific situation and consider any potential future needs before making a decision."
